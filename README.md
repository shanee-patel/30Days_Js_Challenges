# 30DAYS_JS_CHALLENGES

## Day_01: Variable and Data Type

- Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
- Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.

## Day_02: Operators

- Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
- Use assignment operators to modify variables.
- Compare values using `comparison operators`.
- Combine conditions using `logical operators`.
- Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.

## Day_03: Control Structures

- Implement and understand basic `if-else` control flow.
- Use nested `if-else` statements to handle multiple conditions.
- Utilize `switch` cases for control flow based on specific values.
- Apply the `ternary operator` for concise condition checking.
- Combine multiple conditions to solve more complex problems.

## Day_04: Loops

- Understand and use `for` loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
- Utilize `while` loops for iteration based on a condition.
- Apply `do...while` loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
- Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
- Use loop control statements (`break` and `continue`) to control the flow of loops.

## Day_05: Functions

- Understand and define functions using function declarations, expressions, and `arrow` functions.
- Use function parameters and default values effectively.
- Create and utilize `higher-order` functions.
- Apply functions to solve common problems and perform calculations.
- Enhance code reusability and organization using functions.

## Day 06: Arrays

- Create and manipulate arrays using various methods.
- Transform and aggregate array data using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
- Iterate over arrays using loops and iteration methods.
- Understand and work with multi-dimensional arrays.

## Day_07: Objects

- Create and manipulate objects with properties and methods.
- Understand and use the `this` keyword in object methods.
- Work with nested objects and arrays of objects.
- Iterate over an object's properties using loops and built-in methods.

## Day_08: ES6 + Features

- understand and use `template literals` for string interpolation and multi-line strings
- apply destructuring to extract value from arrays and object
- utilize spread and rest operators for arrya manipulation and function arguments
- define function with default parameter
- create object using enhanced object literal including methods and computed property names

## Day_09: DOM Manipulation

- Select and manipulate `DOM elements` using javascript
- Create and append new elements to the DOM.
- Remove elements from the DOM.
- Modify attributes and classws of `HTML elements`.
- Add and handle events to make web pages interactive.

## Day_10: Event Handling

- Add and handle basic events like `click`, `double-click`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `keydown`, and `keyup`.
- Understand and handle from events.
- Implement event delegation to manage events on dynamically added elements.
- Make web pages interactive by responding to various user actions.

## Day_11: Promises and async:await

- Understand and create `promises`, including handling resolved and rejected states.
- Chain multiple promises to perform sequential asynchronous operations.
- Use `async/await` to handle asynchronous code more readably.
- Fetch data from public APIs using both promises and async/await.
- Manage multiple concurrent promises using `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`.

## Day_12: Error Handling

- Understand and implement basic error handling using `try-catch` blocks.
- Use `finallly blocks` to execute code regardless of the try-catch outcome.
- Create and use custom error classes.
- Handle errors in promises using `.catch()` and within async functions using try-catch.
- Implement graceful error handling when making network requests with the fetch API

## Day_13: Modules

- Create and export functions, objects, and constants using modules.
- Import modules using named and default imports.
- Use third-party modules installed via `npm`.
- Understand the basics of module bundling (optional).
